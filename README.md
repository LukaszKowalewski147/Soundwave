Create music from scratch with this mobile app. 

## Description
This project is a tool in which a user can create his own tones to later mix them creating musical composition.

### Tone mixer
Here a user can mix previously created tones on 5 tracks. Mixing is as simple as dragging and dropping tones on track wherever you like.

### Sine wave sound generator
Here a user can generate a simple sine wave sound and listen to it in real time. This mode is perfect to use as speaker tester and to find any rattles caused by low frequency sounds (f.e. in car audio)
